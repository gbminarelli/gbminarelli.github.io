# [ Test Suite - Week 1 ]({% post_url 2019-01-16-testweek1 %})

After some research (see the links under "This Week") I've decided to use Jest as the testing framework on this project. I also started reading about test driven development (TDD) and checked out Jest's official documentation (only the "Getting Started" section of it for now).

## This Week

- Overview of testing tools: https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-in-2018-f68950900bc3
- TDD into with Jest: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-quick-introduction-to-test-driven-development-with-jest-cac71cb94e50?gi=395a512e59c

### Next Week

- Continue reading the documentation.
- Start thinking about/coding the function(s) to be tested.
