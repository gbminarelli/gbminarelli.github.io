# [ Test Suite - Week 2 ]({% post_url 2019-01-24-testweek2 %})

After reading through some of the oficial documentation I've decided to test 5 to 10 simple functions in order to demonstrate the functionalities of the most common "matchers" Jest has to offer.

I also finished the development environment setup and started writing the tutorial (check links under "This Week").

## This Week

- Jest matchers: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers
- Tutorial (first draft): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ilR5qkEbyEevIbCpuVoK7gzTRxuWDSj-pfyPF0mVDjg/edit?usp=sharing

### Next Week

- Start (and possibly finish) writing the test scripts and the functions to be tested.
- Continue writing the tutorial.
