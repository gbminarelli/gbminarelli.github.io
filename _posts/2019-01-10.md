# Project Proposals

- Project A (Tutorial) - **JavaScript Test Suite** (Due Feb. 8)
- Project B (Presentation) - **TicTacToe SPA with Vue.js** (Due Mar. 22)

## JavaScript Test Suite

The idea is to develop a set of scripts to test some of the functions (unit tests) on my second project (Project B) using one of the many JS frameworks available (still TBD). Project B will be developed in paralled with Project A only until I have enough code (functions) to define the test suite (i.e. both projects don't necessarily have to be completed at the same time).

### Next Week

- Choose a framework (research).
- Start reading the available documentation.

## TicTacToe SPA with Vue.js

A TicTacToe web game (SPA) using Vue.js. The application should be complex enough to demostrate the advantages of using the framwork.

### Next Week

- Start reading the available documentation.
