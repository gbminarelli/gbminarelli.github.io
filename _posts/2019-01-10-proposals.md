# Project Proposals

- Project A (Tutorial) - **JavaScript Test Suite** (Due Feb. 8)
- Project B (Presentation) - **TicTacToe SPA with Vue.js** (Due Mar. 22)

## JavaScript Test Suite

The idea is to develop a test suite (of unit tests initially, maybe integrations tests too if I have time) using one of the many JS frameworks available (still to be determined). The functions "to be tested" will also be developed later on (so users have something to test the suite with).

### Next Week

- Choose a framework (research).
- Start reading the available documentation.

## TicTacToe SPA with Vue.js

A TicTacToe web game (SPA) using Vue.js. The application should be complex enough to demostrate the advantages of using the framwork.

### Next Week

- Start reading the available documentation.
