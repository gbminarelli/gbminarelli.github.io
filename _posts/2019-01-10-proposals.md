# [ Project Proposals ]({% post_url 2019-01-10-proposals %})

- Project A (Tutorial) - **JavaScript Test Suite** (Due Feb. 8)
- Project B (Presentation) - **TicTacToe SPA with Vue.js** (Due Mar. 22)

## JavaScript Test Suite

The idea is to develop a test suite (of unit tests, initially) using one of the many JS frameworks available (still to be determined which one exactly). The functions "to be tested" will also be written later on (so users have something to test the suite with).

Testing is always relevant in software development and we don't really have any course focused on anything like this (QA related) at the WMDD program, that is why I wanted to use this opportunity to learn how to use at least one of the available tools.

### Next Week

- Choose a framework (research).
- Start reading the available documentation.

## TicTacToe SPA with Vue.js

A TicTacToe web game (SPA) using Vue.js. The application should be complex enough to demostrate the advantages of using the framwork.

We decided to use Vue.js on our Project 2 this semester so I thought it would be a good idead to learn more about the framework and build something interesting at the same time. The game, despite its simplicity, will be a good example of how we can use the framework to quickly and effectively develope SPAs.

I'll start working on the project as soon as the first one (JS Test Suite) is done.
